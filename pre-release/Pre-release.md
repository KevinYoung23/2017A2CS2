Task 1


Task 1.1

Research the purpose of JSP structure diagrams.



Taks 1.2

Find out the meaning of the different symbols inside the boxes and how these affect the structure of the program.



Repetition is shown by an asterisk(*) in the corner of components that are repeated.

Selection is shown by a circle in the corner of components where only one is chosen.

These affect the structure of the program by adding loops(while) or boolean expressing(if).

While
 
    CALL ReadSalary()

    IF Salary>50:

        THEN

           IF Salary>90
